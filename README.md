# Hr-Dashboard-data-analytics
This is a project that I have done using Microsoft Power Bi

In this project, I gained practical knowledge of implementing data visualization techniques like slicers, line chats, and real-time data updating.
It also helped in gaining knowledge on dax commands and power query.

This project's data set is downloaded from the codebasics.io website which is free to download and to use.
